They measured both the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA to be 98.2% (they report 98.6% in the text but I calculated it from their results table as 98.2% - out of 55 animals, one animal was found to be positive by ELISA when ppNT determined it to be negative, and another animal was found to be negative by ELISA when ppNT determined it to be positive. Muller measured the ELISA to be 99.0% specific when correlated with the MN test. Muller found 153/159 ELISA positive samples to have neutraliing Abs (81%).
